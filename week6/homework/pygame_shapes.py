"""
This program demonstrates how to draw various shapes using the Pygame library.
It includes examples of drawing rectangles, polygons, circles, ellipses, lines, and arcs
with different colors and styles.
Please ensure you have Pygame installed in your Python environment to run this code.
Install pygame using `pip install pygame` if you haven't already.

Play around with the parameters of each shape to see how they affect the drawing!
When you are ready create your own Pygame program to draw a picture of your choice using different shapes.
